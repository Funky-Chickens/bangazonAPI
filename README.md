# Developer Guidelines
## Before making a PR
- convert from tabs to spaces (using 4 spaces)
- check your styles - use airbnb styles for js (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- weed out commented-out code and console logs
- add comments to explain confusing code


## Template for PR comments:  
I made the following changes:

### Steps to test:
- System config (if different)
- Added 3rd party libraries (if added)
- Command line utilities to run (nodemon etc.)
- UI actions to try and expected outcomes:
1. click "log in"
- should redirect to log in form
