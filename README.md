# Developer Guidelines
## Before making a PR
- convert from tabs to spaces (using 4 spaces)
- check your styles - use airbnb styles for js (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- weed out commented-out code and console logs
- add comments to explain confusing code


## Template for PR comments:  
### I made the following changes:  
- change  
- reason


### Steps to test:
- System config (if different)
- Added 3rd party libraries (if added)
- Command line utilities to run (nodemon etc.)
- UI actions to try and expected outcomes:
1. click "log in"
- should redirect to log in form

## When reviewing PR:

+ Pull down the branch and run it on your machine, testing all the 'steps to test' in the PR.
+ Find and put github comment on commented out code and console logs.
+ If there is any piece of code you don't understand, put a comment question (on github).
+ If something looks 'off' style wise, check the airbnb style guide and put a note with that info.
